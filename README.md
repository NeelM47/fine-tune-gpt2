# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for Custom Text Generation

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom dataset using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. The goal is to train the model to generate text based on input prompts, which reflects the language style and content from the custom dataset.

## Project Overview

This project fine-tunes a GPT-2 model, making it adapt to the text patterns found in a user-provided dataset. By training it on specific data, we can make the model generate text in the style of the dataset. This could be useful for creative writing, chatbot responses, or generating content aligned with specific themes.

### Key Features

- Utilizes GPT-2 for natural language generation.
- Fine-tunes on a custom text dataset for specialized text generation.
- Enables flexible prompt-based text generation using a trained model pipeline.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed, along with the necessary libraries.
